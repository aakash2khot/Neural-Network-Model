# Neural-Network-Models

Task 1 - The first task is to make a neural network using Numpy (and some helpers for 
preprocessing and cross-validation) to solve the classification problem of the given 
dataset i.e. MNIST dataset.

Made a NN model without using in-built functions.  
Activation function used - ReLU   
To Classsify - Softmax   
Number of hidden layers - 2  
Used Stochastic gradient descent for faster computations.
Final accuracy of more than 96%. 

Task 2 - The second task is to make a neural network using PyTorch and solve the problem of 
the given dataset i.e. CIFAR 10 dataset.

Activation function used - ReLU 
To Classsify - Softmax 
Number of hidden layers - 8 
Used Stochastic gradient descent for faster computations. 
Final accuracy of more than 57%. 

Note - ANN model is used and not CNN model.
